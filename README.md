# ðŸ›  **Stereocode 1.0**


## ðŸ’¡ **What does it do?**
**Stereocode** classifies **methods** and **classes** based on their **stereotypes** for **C++**, **Java**, and/or **C#** systems.

> Class and method stereotypes are defined in three papers presented at the **IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM)** in 2006, 2009, and 2010 by Dragan, Collard, and Maletic.

**Stereocode**  takes a srcML archive as input, performs static analysis, and annotates each function and class tag in the XML input with an attribute indicating the detected stereotype. For example:

```XML
<class st:stereotype="entity"> ... </class>
<function st:stereotype="get"> ... </function>
```

This output can be used for further processing or analysis. For instance, the stereotype information can be embedded as documentation in the source code (using comments, **Doxygen**, **Javadoc**, etc.).


## ðŸ”§ Installation and Build
1. Prerequisites
- [srcML 1.0+](https://www.srcml.org/) (Only Develop is needed for Linux)
- [cmake 3.17+](https://cmake.org/)
- GCC, Clang, or MSCV with C++17 or higher

2. Clone or download this repository.

3. Build using cmake:

```bash
cmake CMakeLists.txt -B build_path
cd build_path
make
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

**Stereocode**  is a command-line tool. It can process individual source files or whole systems. 

Demo: 
```bash
# This line converts the PowerShell system to the srcML format
srcml PowerShell.zip -o PowerShell.xml

# Saves the output to PowerShell-output.xml
./stereocode PowerShell.xml -o PowerShell-output.xml

# For more options and help:
./stereocode --help
```

Note:</br>
Stereocode can stereotype *free functions*. A *free function* could be a static method/function, a friend function (C++), or simply a function that does not belong to a structure (e.g., class) (C++).

## ðŸ“œ Stereocode Options

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-o, --output-file:**</span> File name of output - srcML archive with stereotypes.

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-p, --primitive-file:**</span> File name of user supplied primitive types (one per line). </br>
```
Datatype_1
Datatype_2
...
```
These data types will be treated as primitive data types such as an **int**.

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-g, --ignore-call-file:**</span> File name of user supplied calls to ignore (one per line). </br>
```
Call_Name_1
Call_Name_2
...
```
Do not use namespaces, parenthesis, or other special characters. Simply list the call name itself. For example, **foo**. </br>
These calls are ignored from analysis. However, usage of fields within these calls (as parameters) are not ignored (considered as accessors to attributes).

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-t, --type-modifier-file:**</span> File name of user supplied data type modifiers to remove (one per line). </br>
```
modifier_1
modifier_2
...
```
These modifiers, such as **public**, are removed during analysis to enhance the detection of certain elements such as primitive data types and method return types. 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-l, --large-class \[int]:**</span> Method threshold for the large-class stereotype (default = 21).

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-i, --interface:**</span> Identify stereotypes for interfaces (C# and Java). 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-n, --union:**</span> Identify stereotypes for unions (C++). 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-m, --enum:**</span> Identify stereotypes for enums (Java). 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-s, --struct:**</span> Identify stereotypes for structs (C# and Java). 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-e, --input-overwrite:**</span> Overwrite input with stereotype information. 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-x, --txt-report:**</span> Output optional TXT report file containing stereotype information. 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-z, --csv-report:**</span> Output optional CSV report file containing stereotype information. 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-c, --comment:**</span> Annotates stereotypes as a comment before method and class definitetions (/** @stereotype stereotype */). 

<span style='color: lightgreen;'>**-v, --verbose:**</span> Outputs default primitives, ignored calls, type modifiers, and extra report files.

## ðŸ““ Developer Notes:

The initial version of this code base was developed by Doleh and documented in his MS Thesis December 2021 at Kent State University. Later, Al-Ramadan updated Stereocode by adding support for additional programming languages (i.e., C# and Java), enabling the stereotyping of complete systems, and incorporating deep static analysis. This work was also documented in MS Thesis May 2024 at Kent State University. Previously, a prototype of **Stereocode** was developed by Collard and Dragan for Dragan's dissertation in December 2010 at KSU. This prototype was further extended for DySDoc 2018 by Decker and Collard.
